1. Project Summary
For this project, I have chosen to work with Kehler Vegetables Company: https://www.kehlervegetables.ca.

The client’s primary needs include:
	•	Modifying the current website design to improve its usability and 				aesthetics.
	•	Reducing the excessive footer height for a cleaner and more 					functional layout.
	•	Enhancing website performance and aligning the company 					branding with its target audience.

Target Audience:
The primary audience is millennials who value local, ethical farming practices and seasonal fresh produce. As a local farm that requires customers to visit in person, the brand must resonate with simplicity and warmth to inspire a sense of trust and quality. The website’s main goal is to attract users through search engines and guide them toward social media engagement.

Website Goals:
	•	Highlight the company’s passion and commitment to high-quality 				products.
	•	Serve as a discovery platform to drive traffic from web searches to 				social media channels.
	•	Encourage users to engage by following the business on social 				media or signing up for a newsletter.

The current Kehler Vegetables website is underperforming. Based on tests conducted from Lighthouse Report, the site scored:
	•	53% for Performance
	•	44% for Accessibility
	•	54% for Best Practices

Additionally, based on tests conducted for San Francisco, USA, the loading speed is approximately 2.26 seconds, which leaves significant room for improvement.




2. Look and Feel
	•	Mood: Fun, Earthy, Community-Oriented, and Friendly.
	•	Inspiration: Two websites that influenced my redesign choices:

	1.	Growers & Co: https://growers.co
		The color palette of this website effectively highlights gardening and 				evokes an earthy feel. I aim to incorporate a similar vibe for Kehler 				Vegetables to enhance its connection to nature and farming.

	2.	Perpetual Vegetable Co: https://perpetualvegetable.com
		I admire how this website showcases its passion for products 					throughout the design. Its flow ensures the products are the focal 				point, which aligns with my goal for Kehler Vegetables—to 					prominently feature their offerings.

	•	Colors:
		Current Brand Colors: 
		Green, White, and Black.

		Redesign Color Palette:
		Green (Primary): #5C8039
		Light White (Neutral): #E9E9E9
		Light Green (Neutral): #9EB388
		Dark Green (Highlight for Cards): #0C450D

This palette was chosen to maintain brand consistency while introducing tones that emphasize freshness and approachability.

	



•	Images:   
Visual elements will be sourced from the existing website and updated and	with some Stock Image as needed to better reflect the brand’s identity.

•	Fonts:
		Headlines: Poppins, with Serif as a fallback.
		Body Copy: Ubuntu, with Serif as a fallback.

These fonts were selected for their modern and approachable style, ensuring readability and alignment with the brand’s personality.
